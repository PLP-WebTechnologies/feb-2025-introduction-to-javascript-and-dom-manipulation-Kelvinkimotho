##  My Implementation

I created a fun and colorful **"Click Challenge"** game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 

- Each click increases the score.
- The background and text colors change randomly with each click.
- Fun messages appear with every point.
- After 10 clicks, the game ends with a congratulatory message!

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic styling â€” all in a playful way!

Happy Coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
